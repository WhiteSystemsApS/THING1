THING1 WiFi Module Library for Arduino - http://www.white-systems.com

THING1 Miniature Wi-Fi Module is a complete platform solution to support wireless functionality.
Due to its small form factor and embedded TCP and UDP protocols, it is a perfect solution for Internet of Things (IoT) devices at very competent prices.
THING1 is based on TI CC3000 Wi-Fi chip and Atmega328p – with physical dimensions of 30mmx18mm. The Wi-Fi Module is programmed and controlled with a simple ASCII command language – only 3 instructions are required to connect the device to a WiFi and start a TCP/UDP server.


The UART interface is standard for THING1 with the following properties:
- Bits per second: 57600
- Data bits: 8
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1
- Flow Control: None
